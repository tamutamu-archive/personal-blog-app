You know what happens to a dynamic, database-backed website over time – it gets slower and slower.  At Dreamhost, we’re constantly upgrading server hardware to keep your site happy and responsive, but there might still be other problems.  If your site is backed by a database, it’s likely that data grows over time – and so do query times. Sometimes, old data simply has to be deleted.  Often, though, the problem can be fixed by adding the correct indexes to larger and larger tables.
